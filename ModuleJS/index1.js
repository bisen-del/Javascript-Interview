// Javascript gives you a way where you can create a module, which you can export or import as per your requirement
// with ES6 version , there are 2 important statemets, "export and import" statements
 export function calc(){
    console.log("Module code executed")
}

// You have to work with a live web server inorder to execute things
// Javascript ES6 provides a provision of importing and exporting of module directly which can be reused when required, unlike older version
// Module means dividing code into various logical pieces and importing them when required
