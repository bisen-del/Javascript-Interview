// ".length property and search methods "

let str = "Desi qna";
console.log(str.length); // str is a primitive data type and executed it is treated as objects

// 2 methods  - indexOf() and lastindexOf()- search for a character or string within a string and the index number 

let str2 = "This is a test";
console.log(str2.indexOf("is")); //.search
console.log(str2.lastIndexOf("is"));


// Difference between indexOf() and search()
// indexOf() can not be used for advanced search operations like regex , it can take start position ("is,2")
// search method can take regular expression as well but will not take start position

// Explain indexOf() and lastIndexOf() method with syntax is given above
