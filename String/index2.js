// template string or template literal is a way to declare the string in javascript

let a = 90;
let str = `I am not new to JS and ${a}`;
console.log(str);



// Advantage of template string : - Template String helps you to store the format as it is then escape sequence is not required for special characters/spaces/new lines

let str2 = `This is 
        Second line and 
                      this is third one`;

console.log(str2);
