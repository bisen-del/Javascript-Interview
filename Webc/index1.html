<!--In the modern web developement there is a very commonly used term called component based architecture-->
<!--The functionalities of a web page are divided into smaller segments and that is what a components based architecture is-->
<!-- In order to implement this architecture you should create web components -->
<!--The advantages of web components are unlimited but to count a few :
    1.) The code gets more manageable
    2.) Developement becomes easy specifically for multiple developers working on a single page but on different components
    3.) Maintainence or error handling becomes more specific to a region or component
    4.) Less developement time as the design is divided into smaller segments
    5.) They are easy to share among other developers so it increases the reusability
    6.) its done in javascript without any dependencies (Your application uses more and more native features rather than depending on 3rd party frameworks)--
    7.)>
    
    <!- A web component is basically the html,css and javascript combination which you can combine/encapsulate inside a component/container which can perform/function independently-->
