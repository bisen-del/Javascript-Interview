<!--Shadow DOM is a way to provide encapsulation to the web component or in other words -shadow DOM is a way to provide seperate hidden DOM to web components i.e: - web components own DOM -->
<!--With the help of shadow dom we made sure that we have the DOM itself in a seperate scope and the shadow DOM as a seperate scope for the web developement-->
<!--When you want to have encapsulation for your web developement , so that it can have its own CSS/settings which does not clash with the original page's DOM - thats why we use Shadow DOM-->



<!-- A template tag allows you to define the HTML template (Template means there is a design - which you can use by making a copy or clone of it)-->
