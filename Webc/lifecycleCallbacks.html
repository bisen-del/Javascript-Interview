<!-- Life Cycle Callbacks-->
<!-- There are methods getting called automatically on different phases of web component if you give them-->

<!-- From components initialization  
     attaching to DOM 
      Modification in between 
      Removed from DOM
      -->

      <!-- Explanation
        when the component is initialized - the constructor() is invoked
        components get attached to the documents DOM at that time the connectedCallback() is invoked
         when the custom element is disconnected from documents DOM -disconnectedCallback() is invoked
         During the existence of component - if an attribute is added, removed or even value changed then attributeChangedCallback() is invoked
         when the component is moved on a new page/document then  adoptedCallback() is invoked which is very rarely used -->
