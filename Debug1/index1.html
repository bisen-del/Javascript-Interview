<!--Any Application or program that you think of , may have some or other issues or errors like sometimes it might have run time errors or may be 
 design-time errors, which you need to resolve to get the desired output-->
 <!--Debugging is the process of searching and resolving the bugs or errors from the code-->
<!--what are run time and design time errors -->
<!--Run-time error is a program error that occurs at the time of execution i.e:-while the program is running-->
<!--Run-time errors are referred to as "bugs"-->
<!--These errors are faced by the end user i.e: - the user of the program, the application or the web page-->
<!-- Design time errors are the ones that occurs at the time of developement at the time of designing the application i.e:, while the developer is coding-->
<!--The developers have to run logs, debug code, check response time from the server, all such types of operations you can manage, you can check in the browsers developer tool-->
<!--As the name explains, the developer tool is meant for developers-->
<!--Break-point: - Breakpoint is a point that we put on a line of code where we want the debugger to stop or pause the execution to find the error or exception-->
<!--When the exact region of code to debug is known, then we can use line breakpoints-->
<!--Event listener is an internal process that waits for any event to occur, so that the action which has to execute after that event is fired, can be executed-->
<!--program break points-->
<!--debugger-->
<!--It is same as setting a breakpoint, but because it is set in the program, it is called the programmatic breakpoint-->
<!--The conditional breakpoints are the breakpoints that will be pause the execution only when, the provided condition has a truthy result-->
<!--xhr/fetch breakpoint pauses the execution only when it finds the specific string in it-->

<!--How to check the code execution time-->
