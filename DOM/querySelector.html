<!--querySelector() and querySelectorAll()-->
<!--There is also querySelector methods which search using CSS selector-->
<!--There are 2 such methods commonly used & one must know as Javascript developer-->
<!--querySelector()-->
<!--querySelectorAll()-->
<!--The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector inside the method given as an arguement-->
<!--It searches in the entire document-->
<!--Instead of the first element, if you want all the elements then you can use the querySelectorAll() method-->

<!--Query selectors are a powerful feature in web development that allow you to select elements from a web page based on certain criteria. Here are some important points about query selectors:

Query selectors are part of the Document Object Model (DOM) API and are used to access and manipulate elements on a web page.

Query selectors use a syntax similar to CSS selectors to select elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, and more.

You can use query selectors to select one or multiple elements at once, and to access their properties and modify their content.

Common query selector methods in JavaScript include querySelector(), which returns the first matching element, and querySelectorAll(), which returns a NodeList containing all matching elements.

Query selectors are supported in all modern web browsers and can be used with both vanilla JavaScript and popular libraries and frameworks like jQuery.

Query selectors can be a powerful tool for improving the functionality and user experience of your web pages, but they should be used judiciously and with care to avoid performance issues and potential security vulnerabilities.-->

          console.log(element);
          const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".a");  // it returns all the elements which have class a
