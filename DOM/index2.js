//What is the difference between window and document object model
// window is the global container 
// document object is child of window object
// Operations related to entire browser can be part of window object

// OPen the console in the html
// now experiment with the window values
// like type window
// setInterval() or setTimeout() etc are methods of window 
// console.log(window.innerHeight)
//console.log(innerWidth)
// Take a look at screenshot provided to understand
// console.log(window.location)
// console.log(location.href)
// BOM - browser object model contains screen location navigator frames history xmlhttpRequest
// DOM API it means the browser is giving you the document object which helps you to access the elements through javascript
// BOM means browser object model it gives you few objects related to window and using that we access location, history, screen, height and width of window
